# Speak Smart üó£Ô∏è
This project is a Speech Translation and Text-to-Speech Converter, which allows users to perform the following tasks:

Project Overview

Record Speech: The program records audio using a microphone and saves it as a WAV file.

Speech Recognition: The recorded audio is processed using a speech recognition library to convert the user's spoken words into text.

Language Translation: The recognized text is translated into a user-specified language using the Translator class from the translate library.

Text-to-Speech Conversion: The translated text is converted into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.

The output is saved as an MP3 file that can be played back.

# Get Startedüí´
#### 1. Its recommended to install the modules/libraries in a virtual environment. In order to create one run the codes given below in the windows terminal/bash.

- Use the cd command to navigate to your project's folder:
```bash
cd path\to\your\project
```
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- To activate the virtual environment, run: 
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. Once the virtual environment is active, install the necessary libraries using the windows terminal.
```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```
#### 3. Enable microphone access for the compilers/interpreters that you are using.
