# Speak Smart üó£Ô∏è
This project is a Speech Translation and Text-to-Speech Converter, which allows users to perform the following tasks:

**Project Overview**

- *Record Speech*: The program records audio using a microphone and saves it as a WAV file.

- *Speech Recognition:* The recorded audio is processed using a speech recognition library to convert the user's spoken words into text.

- *Language Translation:* The recognized text is translated into a user-specified language using the Translator class from the translate library.

- *Text-to-Speech Conversion:* The translated text is converted into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library.

- The output is saved as an MP3 file that can be played back.

# Challenges Faced During Development

#### 1. Microphone Access Issues
- The microphone couldn‚Äôt be accessed by the Python interpreter despite correct setup.
- *Solution:* Ensured proper device selection and permissions, and verified the correct installation of pyaudio.
#### 2. Module Import Errors
- Encountered "module not found" errors even after installing libraries like speech_recognition.
*Solution:* Resolved by manually installing missing dependencies and using alternative libraries when needed.
#### 3. Dependency Management
- Faced conflicts between library versions, causing installation failures.
- *Solution:* Used a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure compatibility.


# Get Startedüí´
#### 1. Its recommended to install the modules/libraries in a virtual environment. In order to create one, run the codes given below in the windows terminal/bash.

- Use the cd command to navigate to your project's folder:
```bash
cd path\to\your\project
```
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- To activate the virtual environment, run: 
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. Once the virtual environment is active, install the necessary libraries using the windows terminal.
```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```
#### 3. Enable microphone access for the compilers/interpreters that you are using.
